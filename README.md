# MiMB_biomass
biomass composition data of CHO-K1 in mid-exponential phase 

Conditions:

batch culture in Erlenmeyer non-baffled flasks

Medium: HyClone ActiPro (GE Healthcare) with 8 mM Glutamine and 0.2% Anti-Clumping Agent

Files:

"MiMB_biomass_K1_Act.csv" - macromolecular biomass composition (protein, lipid, RNA, DNA, carbohydrate, dry cell mass) in pg per cell

"MiMB_lipids_K1_Act.csv" - lipid composition in nmol per 10^7 cells

"MiMB_aminoacids_K1_Act.csv" - amino acid composition in umol per mg dry cell mass 
(for conversion into grams use molecular masses of AA in peptides = AA molecular mass minut 1 H2O molecule)
